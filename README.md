# Goad

Goad is an AWS Lambda powered, highly distributed,
load testing tool built in Go for the 2016 [Gopher Gala][].

**Go + Load** â‡’ **Goad**

## How it works

Goad takes full advantage of the power of Amazon Lambdas for distributed load testing. You can use goad to launch HTTP loads from up to four AWS regions at once. Each lambda can handle hundreds of concurrent connections, we estimate that Goad should be able to achieve peak loads of up to **10,000 requests/second**.
